# React Table
This project is not for production use, it just a side project that can become unmaintained/change the public API in any moment.

## Installation
```bash
npm install @forazens/react-table
# or
yarn add @forazens/react-table
```

## Why this project?
The main objective for this project is for testing how to create a complete react library.

A secondary objective is to provide a simple, declarative API for the library [React-table v7](https://github.com/tanstack/react-table/tree/v7) from [Tanner Linsley](https://twitter.com/tannerlinsley).
